# Credit-Risk
A large, imbalanced data of loan data analysis and ML models.
It was mainly done to enrich my knowledge in use of deep learning for credit risk and loan borrowing domain.
Unfortunetly, the zipped folder with all data contains an equivalent of 1.3 gb memory, so I can't upload it on GitHub.
However, if you are interested, feel free to reach me by my LinkedIn or personal website. I will be glad to transfer the data by another source.
